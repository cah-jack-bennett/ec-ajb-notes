Subject: Please review DB [MemberRepository] in new server [AOCWSAPING03]

Tracy,
 
Server = AOCWSAPING03
DB = [MemberRepository]
 
I have created this DB [MemberRepository] in new server. Before I do anything else, I’d like to have you review it and let’s make sure I understand the request.
It’s an empty DB, meaning no tables, no views were created.  I wonder if they want us to create the table structure, but with no data (just thinking out loud)? … let’s verify with requestor.
 
DB objects created:
Database Roles
Users  but only if it has a corresponding Login at the server level (no SQL Authenticated users created)
Schemas
User Defined Table Types
 
DB Object NOT Created:
Tables
Views
Stored Procedures
User Defined functions
 
Please let me know your feed back.  If it all looks good, I can also take care of the other DB [OutcomesIdentification]

Team,
 
Server = [aocwSaping03]
DBs:
[MemberRepository]
[OutcomesIdentification]
 
These 2 DBs have been migrated from server [aocwSaping02] -> [aocwSaping03].
 
DB objects created:
* Tables   <- except for Backup tables such as [dbo].[flyway_schema_history_bkp_20190819]
* Views    <- except for Backup views
* Stored Procedures <- except for backup SP
* User Defined functions
* Database Roles
* Users <- but only if it has a corresponding Login at the server level (no SQL Authenticated users because we don’t have its password)
* Schemas
* User Defined Table Types
 
My comments:

* A few DB objects were not migrated, because they are currently invalid in ING02, for example:

DB [MemberRepository]
View  = [ZZZ___snapshot_prescriptionRepository] has an invalid column name ‘repositoryRxNumberID’.
Because of the invalid column that is being used inside this View, it is invalid in current DB and wasn’t migrated to new DB.
 
Jack,
Please review with your team, and let me know, if you have any questions.
